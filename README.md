Image: The triangles of a bunny mesh transform along surface normals to the beat of a sinusoidal wave. 

## About geometry shaders
Here are some key concepts:
- **Rendering pipeline**: Vertex Shader > Geometry Shader > Fragment Shader
- **Vertex Input**: Processes vertices of primitives (points, lines, or triangles), which are sent from the vertex shader.
- **Execution**: Runs once per primitive, enabling the creation of new vertices or discarding existing ones. 
- **Primitive Output**: Can emit new primitives of a different type than the input, transforming the overall geometry.
